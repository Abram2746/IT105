  <h1>Let's Learn about Local Area Networks</h1>
    <!--LAN information was taken from howtogeek.com-->
  <p>Put simply, a Local Area Network (LAN) is a group of computers and other
  devices that are connected together over a network and are all in the same location
  —typically within a single building like an office or home. LANs are typically
  confined within a small area—usually one building, but that’s not a firm requirement.
  That area might be your home or small business, and it could contain just a few devices.
  It might also be a much larger area, like an entire office building that contains hundreds
  or thousands of devices. If you want to learn more information about LANs,

    <h1>Onto HTML</h1>
    
    <!--I took information about this topic from https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML -->
    
    <p>HTML stands for <strong><i>Hyper Text Markup Language</i></strong>. The HTML language is what's used to build websites and
    goes hand-in-hand with other coding languages like CSS and JavaScript which are used to enhance the design of the webpage.
    "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a
    fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an
    active participant in the World Wide Web. </p>

    <h1>What I've Learned</h1>
    
    <!--These are sources I used to educate myself
    1: Khan Academy: https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css/html-tags-continued/pt/html-links
    
    2: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_meta.asp -->
    
    <p>The project required me to learn different things. There are many different elements in an html document. Going over
    specificities on things like making links appear within a text or having an image be shown a certain way requires great attention
    to detail. Something that was very interesting to me was the <i>meta</i> tag. Essentially, the <i>meta</i> tag provides metadata
    about the HTML document, meaning that it sees the information, but won't display it to the user browsing the web. </p>
